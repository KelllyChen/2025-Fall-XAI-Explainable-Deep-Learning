- Used a pretrained ResNet-18 model on healthy and pneumonia-affected chest X-rays
- Implemented GradCAM and two of its variants, XGradCAM and EigenCAM to 10 images
- Generated and presented visualizations showing what regions of the image the model is focusing on for its predictions.
- Wrote a reflection on these XAI techniques
